                <p>difference between javascript object literals and JSON</p>
                <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, but it is language-independent, meaning it can be used in conjunction with many different programming languages</p>
                <p>Why JSON?
                    Standard Format: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
                    Language Agnostic: JSON is language-independent, but it uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. This makes it a great choice for exchanging data between a server and a client that might be written in different languages.
                    Fetching Data from a Server:
                    When you make a request to a server to get data (e.g., using the fetch API), the server often responds with data in JSON format. Hereâ€™s why and how we handle that:
                    
                    Server Responds with JSON:
                    
                    Servers send data in JSON format because it is a standardized format that can be easily parsed and used by various programming languages and environments.
                    Fetching and Parsing JSON:
                    
                    When you fetch data using fetch, you get a Response object.
                    To use the data in your JavaScript code, you need to parse the JSON string into a JavaScript object. This is done using response.json(), which returns a Promise that resolves to a JavaScript object</p>
