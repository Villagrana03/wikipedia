                <h2>While Loop</h2>
                <p>In Python, a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. This means the While loop would be iterating as long is the condition is true, if its false the loop will be broken</p>

                <h2>While loops</h2>
                <p>This is an example of normal while loops, i will be explaining in the comments how they work.</p>
                <p>The condition is evaluated. If the condition is True, the code block inside the loop is executed. If the condition is False initially, the code block is skipped entirely, and the program continues with the statement immediately following the while loop.</p>

                1. Using and
                while (userInput != "q" and lives != 0):
                The loop continues if both conditions are true.
                The loop stops if either userInput is "q" or lives is 0.
                2. Using or
                while (userInput != "q" or lives != 0):
                The loop continues if at least one condition is true.
                The loop stops if both conditions are false.</p> -->
